# Welcome

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code and make the most of my lessons in class.

## VS Code Project

I love VS Code and for new programmers that want the feeling of industry standard power at their finger-tips this nifty code editor has by far the best UX. Do not take my word for it though - see what [others](https://twitter.com/Una/status/1127957563876753409) have to say or find out for yourself. To get set up at home please read my [blog post](https://erikacamilleri.wixsite.com/bytesizelearning/post/setting-up-your-development-environment).

### Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: here we maintain Java source code or in other terms our program files
- `lib`: here we store libraries which are code bundles we can use to get advanced features

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there. However, this is not recommended.

### Library Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your libraries and code bundles. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Java In Two Semesters

I personally find that [this book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-99420-8) offers a clear structure for learning in which each chapter maps onto one week of a twelve week semester, with the chapter content mapping on to a two hour lecture. Each chapter has a set of learning outcomes which are almost identical to IB's assessment statements. There are good self-test tutorial questions, and practical lab tasks which you can do <u>in your own time</u>. I do share my digital copy [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1__HThQ-lmUrSt99PtFGQ537Z4pYxAj9t/view?pli=1).

## IB Learning Outcomes

IB is an intensive course so there is no time to waste. Whilst I really would like that my programming lessons are aligned with your personal goals and interests we do have a task to do. For each chapter we cover from the book I will write a README file with notes that highlight the most important learning outcomes as worded in the syllabus.

For example, today in class I made sure start working in...

- 4.3.4 Explain the need for higher level languages

Although do not expect a linear journey. We will be tackling this learning outcome all throughout the course! IB assessment statements are not exactly a check-list. However, I promise to do my very best to make the journey transparent and to make you feel like we are progressing through the curriculum.

Are you ready to code venture with me?
