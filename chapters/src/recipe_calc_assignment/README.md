# Year 12 Java Assignment (2023 - 2024)

This piece of individual work will contribute towards your Continuous Assessment which is part of your Mid-Year report.

## Recipe Calculator for Alex

### Scope of the problem to be tackled

You will build a a Recipe Calculator in Java for Alex using the techniques you learned. The program must address the most basic success criteria:
- Alex would like to select a recipe from a variety of recipes that are pre-loaded into the application so that he can choose to follow a recipe with ingredients he is comfortable with.
- Alex would like a paginated view of recipe summaries so that selection is more intuitive.
- Alex would like to specify servings of the selected recipe and automatically receive adjusted quantities of ingredients so that he can plan a shopping list efficiently.

The program should load recipe records from a csv file and display a paginated view of recipe excerpts to either help Alex make a selection quickly or go to the next page. When Alex makes a selection, the program should ask him to input the number of servings so that the recipe can be adjusted. The logic required for this calculation is in the `Recipe` class.

### Your learning outcomes

Programming is an endeavour students find challenging, but it is the most prominent component of IB Computer Science. Having a program like this one is the best way to get your portfolio started! Recipe Calculator apps are popular in the market, and the rise of the eco-friendly consumer has been the inspiration behind this simple assignment. You already proved some ability in our *Code Anything Thursdays*. Now, it is time to level up so that you will be ready to take on your IA in February. In fact, this assignment also comes with a booklet that gives you background information about the client, his goals, and needs to give you an initial idea of what is yet to come.

After you complete this assignment you would have shown me that you are able to:

- Build on someone else's work.
- Implement a program based on a technical plan.
- Learn on your own initiative as needed to solve a non-trivial problem.

## Delivery

Please upload a zipped folder on MySchool that contains a Visual Studio Code Java Project which obeys the following structure:

- `RecipeCalcApp.java` which contains the `main()`
- `Recipe.java`
- `recipes.csv`

## Do not make this about the code

> The most important takeaway is building the right attitude for problem-solving.

Assignments tend to have a bad rep because of the pressure that comes with them and if you do make it all about the pressure then you will not get the learning outcomes you need. This task should be *fun* to do and help is available. To get proficient with programming in any language you must immerse yourself for a resonable amount of time.
